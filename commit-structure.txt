Refactor the coupon UI

Because:
- The old UI code is fairly slow
- There were a few unused dependencies
- The old UI has aged poorly

I thought it was necessary to remove some of the old coupon UI code.
Unfortunately, it has aged pretty poorly, and I think this refactor makes
the code much easier to support in the long-run. Primarily, this commit
improves the performance of the coupon component. It also removes some
unused dependencies.

These changes should resolve issue #1337.

This commit removed the left-pad dependency, so please stop using it!
